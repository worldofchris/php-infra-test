# Windemnity Technical Test

Starting with the [Laravel example app](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x#your-first-laravel-project)
We'd like you to adapt it as described below and then deploy it with a github action to
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

We want to see logs and monitoring of the resources once they are deployed.
Developers need to know how to update the application once it has been deployed.
We want to make sure that the security of the application will not be compromised.
