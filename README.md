# PHP / Infrastructure Technical Test

We'd like you to create a simple [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) application to present a 
table in a webpage containing data retrieved from a [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database.

We'd like to see this deployed to one of:

* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
* [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com)

If you want to use Heroku you'll need to sign up for a free personal account if you don't have one already.
If you want to use AWS or GCP we can provide you with a project/account to deploy to.

We'd like to see this deployed using a [Github action](https://github.com/features/actions)

The data for the database can be found in [`nibs.csv`](./assets/nbis.csv)

Here's some background on the data:

* Enterprise Value - this is essentially purchase price eg £100,000,000 etc
* Signing date - date the deal will close by
* Industry sector e.g. ‘retail’ ‘manufacturing’ ‘infrastructure’ etc
* Client company name
* Target country of incorporation
* Amount being sold as a percentage

## What were looking for

* How you validate your understanding of requirements
* How you test your code
* How you communicate when working
* How you document your work
* Use of version control
* What do you do to make this service operationally ready

## Extra Credit

* Automated testing in the Github Action
* Logging / Tracing
* Monitoring - ideally with alerts to the slack channel described below
* Use a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) rather than a Sqlite database

## What next?

Once you have read this README email `CONTACT ADDRESS` and we will add you to a slack
channel where we can discuss the work as it proceeds and answer any questions you have.

We will provide you with a GitHub repo to push your code to and to host your actions.
